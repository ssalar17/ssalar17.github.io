Responsive design is a type of approach to web development that allows 
dynamic changes to how a website will look. It basically makes a dynamic change 
to layouts, images, and cascading style sheet media queries (Rouse, 2012). So if a site page 
registers the size of the users screen, an adjustment is made to the layout of 
the site. I discovered that the responsive design approach solves many issues 
regarding the size of new devices (Rouse, 2012). 

Responsive design relates to web technologies because almost all websites
in this day and age require a mobile version of their site (Smashing Team, 2011). New technologies
with different resolutions and screen sizes are constantly being developed, 
so switching a site from webpage to mobile friendly design is now essential.
Web pages now take full advantage of this feature, before only a few number 
of sites had them. They can take advantage by ensuring that their images and 
layout can be automatically adjusted by making them flexible. Some web pages
can use crop methods with the h1 element (Smashing Team, 2011). 

One of the main techniques I used was  ".container" which is a base style 
that works for any type of screen. I them used "em" on different nav's and 
ul in order to ensure the style of the screen can change depending on the size
of "em". "@media" is a breakpoint that I used for media queries in CSS as well.
The size will be applied to the web site and the syntax I used was mainly 
"@media (min-width: 12em) {" as an example. 

I learned that numerous techniques can be applied in order to dynamically 
alter a web site to fit the type of size needed. It is a useful technique to 
learn and advance on as it is something that is constantly evolving in the 
market and web sites are being constantly altered on a daily basis.
